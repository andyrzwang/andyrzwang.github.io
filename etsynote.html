        <p style="font-size: large;">
            Hello BudkaShop, 
            <br> <br>
            If you are reading this, it means I purchased Tribal pattern with personalization guitar strap from your store.
            <br> <br>
            It would be great if you can engrave my design on the strap. 
            I attached a zip file containing two image, one with white background, other one is transparent.
            Please adjust the size of the image respect to the space on the guitar strap.
            <br>
            Although the template design are landscape and my design are portrait. But I am sure you can make everything works! 
            My goal is when I play my guitar, the strap will be vertical and displayed at the correct angle.
            <br> <br>
            I am extremely excited about the finishing product.
            <br> <br>
            Thank you!
            <br>
            Andy
